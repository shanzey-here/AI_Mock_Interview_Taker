      <h2>Production-Ready AI Systems</h2>
      <p>Building AI systems that scale requires careful planning and robust architecture. Our TensorFlow-based approach has enabled us to process millions of predictions daily with high accuracy and reliability.</p>
      
      <h3>Pipeline Architecture</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> Real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Automated feature extraction and transformation</li>
        <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Distributed training across GPU clusters</li>
        <li><strong>Model Serving:</strong> TensorFlow Serving for low-latency inference</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
      <p>Our AI pipeline handles 5M+ predictions daily with 99.5% uptime and sub-100ms latency. Model accuracy improved by 15% through continuous learning.</p>
